    Memory Service for AI agents.

    The service stores all messages exchanged between agents, users, and
    other actors, supports replay and forking of conversations, and exposes
    user-facing and agent-facing APIs. Conversation access is controlled by
    per-user permissions (owner, manager, writer, reader).

        - `history` (default) returns the user-visible conversation between
          users and the agent.
        - `memory` returns agent memory messages which are typically not
          shown directly to end users. Memory messages are scoped to the
          calling client id derived from the API key.

        Synchronizes the in-memory context for the conversation. The service fails
        when any message is not targeting the `memory` channel, then compares the
        provided list to the messages already stored in the latest memory epoch.
        If there is no difference it is a no-op, if the list merely appends more
        messages they are added to the current epoch, otherwise a new epoch is
        created and all provided messages are stored under the new epoch. Memory
        sync is scoped to the calling client id (from the API key). Requires a
        valid agent API key.
