        Lists conversations across all users. Supports filtering by userId,

        **Fork Tree Behavior**: Conversations can be forked to create branches. All forks
        share the same "conversation group" (fork tree). The `mode` parameter controls
        which conversations from each fork tree are returned.

            - `roots`: only include root conversations (conversations that are not forks).
