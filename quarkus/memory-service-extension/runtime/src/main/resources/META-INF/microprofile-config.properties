# The extension pulls in quarkus-grpc for the client (ResponseRecorderService),
# which also enables the gRPC server in dev mode by default. Disable it since
# apps using this extension typically only need the client.
# Apps that need the gRPC server can override this in their application.properties.

# The generated REST client interfaces (SearchApi, etc.) have bean-validation
# annotations on method parameters. When CDI creates proxy wrappers, Hibernate
# Validator sees the inherited constraints as redefinitions (HV000151).
# This setting allows the CDI proxy to inherit the same constraints.
