Welcome to the Memory Service documentation. This guide will help you integrate persistent memory into your AI agents.

## What is Memory Service?

Memory Service is a backend service designed to solve the persistent memory problems for AI agents systems. It stores all messages exchanged between agents, users, and LLMs in a structured, queryable format.

### Key Capabilities

- **Persistent conversation storage** - All messages are stored with full context and metadata
- **Resumable response streams** - Long lived response streams can survive client reconnects or user device swtiching
- **Conversation replay/audit** - Reconstruct converstation history and agent memory state as it was at any point in time
- **Conversation forking** - Fork a conversation at any message to explore alternative paths
- **Access control** - User-based ownership and sharing with fine-grained permissions
- **Multi-database support** - Works with PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- **Semantic Search** - Search across all conversations using vector similarity
- **Encrypted** - All database data is encrypted for enhanced security

## Architecture Overview

Memory Service is packaged as container image and provides both REST and gRPC APIs. It's designed to be:

- **Backend Service** - Designed to be used as an internal service used by your AI agent systems
- **Lightweight** - Minimal overhead for your agent infrastructure
- **Flexible** - Works with your existing database and vector stores
- **Secure** - Provides access control and fine-grained permissions
- **Stateless** - No state is stored in the service itself, making it easy to scale horizontally

## Project Status

Memory Service is currently a proof of concept under active development. APIs may change as we refine the design based on real-world usage.
