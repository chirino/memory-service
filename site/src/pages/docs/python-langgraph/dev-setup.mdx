Use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for deterministic Python environments and lockfile-driven installs. Use Docker for dependency services (memory-service, Keycloak, databases), not as your day-to-day Python package workflow.

## Step 1 (Temporary): Build Local Package Wheels

Until the packages are published, build them locally and point `uv` to the local wheel directories:

```bash
cd python/langchain
uv build
export UV_FIND_LINKS="$PWD/dist"
```

For the [Episodic Memories](/docs/python-langgraph/memories/) guide, also build the LangGraph package:

```bash
cd python/langgraph
uv build
export UV_FIND_LINKS="$UV_FIND_LINKS:$PWD/dist"
```

This is temporary. After the packages are released, you can remove `UV_FIND_LINKS`.

## Baseline Runtime

<CodeFromFile
  file="python/examples/langgraph/doc-checkpoints/02-with-checkpointing/.python-version"
  lang="text"
/>

<CodeFromFile
  file="python/examples/langgraph/doc-checkpoints/02-with-checkpointing/pyproject.toml"
  lang="toml"
/>

This is the minimum dependency set users need to run Memory Service-backed LangGraph examples.
Until the package is released, `memory-service-langchain` is resolved from the local wheel built in Step 1 (`UV_FIND_LINKS`).

## Local Workflow

```bash
# one-time Python install
uv python install 3.11

# install deps from lock
cd python/examples/langgraph/doc-checkpoints/02-with-checkpointing
uv sync --frozen

# run app
uv run uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9090
```
