This guide shows how to add conversation sharing and ownership transfer APIs to the LangGraph tutorial app.

> **New to sharing concepts?**
> Read [Sharing & Access Control](/docs/concepts/sharing/) first to understand access levels and transfer flow.

## Prerequisites

**Starting checkpoint**: This guide starts from [python/examples/langgraph/doc-checkpoints/03-with-history](https://github.com/chirino/memory-service/tree/main/python/examples/langgraph/doc-checkpoints/03-with-history)

Make sure you've completed:
- [LangGraph Conversation History](/docs/python-langgraph/conversation-history/) - History recording and conversation APIs
- Multiple users in Keycloak (`bob`, `alice`, `charlie`)

Also complete **Step 2** in [LangGraph Dev Setup](/docs/python-langgraph/dev-setup/) (build local `memory-service-langchain` wheel + `UV_FIND_LINKS`); this is temporary until the package is released.

## Membership Endpoints

Checkpoint `06` adds membership endpoint passthroughs to the tutorial app:

<CodeFromFile
  file="python/examples/langgraph/doc-checkpoints/06-sharing/app.py"
  lang="python"
  lines="86-109"
/>

**What changed**: `GET /v1/conversations/{conversation_id}/memberships`, `POST /v1/conversations/{conversation_id}/memberships`, `PATCH /v1/conversations/{conversation_id}/memberships/{user_id}`, and `DELETE /v1/conversations/{conversation_id}/memberships/{user_id}` are added. Each delegates to the corresponding `proxy.*_membership` method.

**Why**: These endpoints expose Memory Service's access-control layer to frontend clients. `MemoryServiceProxy` forwards each call with both the agent's API key and the authenticated user's bearer token so Memory Service can enforce that only conversation owners or managers may modify membership. The agent app does not implement any membership logic itself — it simply proxies the call through.

## Ownership Transfer Endpoints

Checkpoint `06` also exposes ownership transfer APIs:

<CodeFromFile
  file="python/examples/langgraph/doc-checkpoints/06-sharing/app.py"
  lang="python"
  lines="112-135"
/>

**What changed**: `GET /v1/ownership-transfers`, `POST /v1/ownership-transfers`, `POST /v1/ownership-transfers/{transfer_id}/accept`, and `DELETE /v1/ownership-transfers/{transfer_id}` are added, all forwarded through `proxy.*_ownership_transfer` methods.

**Why**: Ownership transfer is a two-step operation: the current owner initiates a transfer, and the recipient accepts or declines it. Exposing these endpoints through the agent app means frontend clients can manage the full transfer lifecycle using the user's bearer token, without needing direct access to the Memory Service admin API.

## Testing Membership Management

Define a token helper for multiple users:

```bash
function get-token() {
  local username=${1:-bob}
  local password=${2:-$username}
  curl -sSfX POST http://localhost:8081/realms/memory-service/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "client_id=memory-service-client" \
    -d "client_secret=change-me" \
    -d "grant_type=password" \
    -d "username=$username" \
    -d "password=$password" \
    | jq -r '.access_token'
}
```

<TestScenario checkpoint="python/examples/langgraph/doc-checkpoints/06-sharing">

Create a conversation as bob:

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 200
`}>

```bash
curl -sSfX POST http://localhost:9090/chat/466db939-7218-4d03-9e31-810b134c063a \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token bob bob)" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "Hello, starting a sharing test conversation."
```

</CurlTest>

List memberships:

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should contain "bob"
`}>

```bash
curl -sSfX GET http://localhost:9090/v1/conversations/466db939-7218-4d03-9e31-810b134c063a/memberships \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token bob bob)" | jq
```

</CurlTest>

Add alice as a writer:

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 201
And the response should contain "alice"
`}>

```bash
curl -sSfX POST http://localhost:9090/v1/conversations/466db939-7218-4d03-9e31-810b134c063a/memberships \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token bob bob)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"alice","accessLevel":"writer"}' | jq
```

</CurlTest>

</TestScenario>

## Testing Ownership Transfers

Initiate an ownership transfer:

```bash
curl -sSfX POST http://localhost:9090/v1/ownership-transfers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token bob bob)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "conversationId": "466db939-7218-4d03-9e31-810b134c063a",
    "newOwnerUserId": "alice"
  }' | jq
```

List transfers for the recipient:

```bash
curl -sSfX GET "http://localhost:9090/v1/ownership-transfers?role=recipient" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token alice alice)" | jq
```

Accept a transfer:

```bash
curl -sSfX POST http://localhost:9090/v1/ownership-transfers/<transfer-id>/accept \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token alice alice)"
```

Decline or cancel a transfer:

```bash
curl -sSfX DELETE http://localhost:9090/v1/ownership-transfers/<transfer-id> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token alice alice)"
```

## What's Next

You've now added collaborative features (memberships and ownership transfer) to your LangGraph tutorial app.

Next, continue to [Indexing and Search](/docs/python-langgraph/indexing-and-search/) to add searchable indexed content.
