title: Python LangGraph Guides
description: Integrate Memory Service with Python FastAPI + LangGraph agents.
---

These guides walk through an incremental Python integration path for [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) developers:
- Start from a minimal stateless LangGraph chatbot
- Turn on memory-service features one by one
- Keep code changes small and explicit using checkpoint-based diffs

Each guide references runnable checkpoints under `python/examples/langgraph/doc-checkpoints/` and includes `site-tests`-backed curl scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, complete [LangGraph Dev Setup](/docs/python-langgraph/dev-setup/) and ensure Memory Service + Keycloak are running.
Also complete **Step 2** on that page (build local `memory-service-langchain` wheel + `UV_FIND_LINKS`); this is temporary until the package is released.

## Tutorial Path

### [Getting Started](/docs/python-langgraph/getting-started/)
Build a minimal LangGraph chatbot, then enable memory-backed conversations with persistent checkpointing.

### [Conversation History](/docs/python-langgraph/conversation-history/)
Record USER/AI turns in the history channel and expose read APIs.

### [Indexing and Search](/docs/python-langgraph/indexing-and-search/)
Add indexed history content and conversation search.

### [Conversation Forking](/docs/python-langgraph/conversation-forking/)
Pass fork metadata and list conversation forks.

### [Response Resumption](/docs/python-langgraph/response-resumption/)
Stream responses and support resume-check, resume, and cancel.

### [Sharing](/docs/python-langgraph/sharing/)
Add memberships and ownership transfer APIs.

### [Episodic Memories](/docs/python-langgraph/memories/)
Use the LangGraph `BaseStore` backend to give your agent persistent per-user memories.

## Reference

### [Dev Setup](/docs/python-langgraph/dev-setup/)
Reproducible `uv` workflow, Dockerized dependencies, and fast Python-only docs tests.
