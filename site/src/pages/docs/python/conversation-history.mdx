This guide continues from [Python Getting Started](/docs/python/getting-started/) and shows how to record conversation history and expose APIs for frontend applications.

## Prerequisites

**Starting checkpoint**: View the code from the previous section at [python/examples/doc-checkpoints/02-with-memory](https://github.com/chirino/memory-service/tree/main/python/examples/doc-checkpoints/02-with-memory)

Make sure you've completed the [Python Getting Started](/docs/python/getting-started/) guide first. You should have:
- A working LangChain agent with Memory Service checkpointing
- Memory Service running via Docker Compose
- OIDC authentication configured

Also complete **Step 2** in [Python Dev Setup](/docs/python/dev-setup/) (build local `memory-service-langchain` wheel + `UV_FIND_LINKS`); this is temporary until the package is released.

## Enable Conversation History Recording

In the previous guide, you added conversation memory, but frontend conversation views still need `history` channel entries.

To enable that, wire `MemoryServiceHistoryMiddleware` into the agent and bind request context:

<CodeFromFile
  file="python/examples/doc-checkpoints/03-with-history/app.py"
  lang="python"
  lines="52-64"
/>

The middleware records user and AI turns to the `history` channel while the checkpointer continues to store LangGraph state in the `memory` channel.

<TestScenario checkpoint="python/examples/doc-checkpoints/03-with-history">

Make sure you define a shell function that can get the bearer token for the bob user:

```bash
function get-token() {
  curl -sSfX POST http://localhost:8081/realms/memory-service/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "client_id=memory-service-client" \
    -d "client_secret=change-me" \
    -d "grant_type=password" \
    -d "username=bob" \
    -d "password=bob" \
    | jq -r '.access_token'
}
```

Now test it again.

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should contain "42"
`}>

```bash
curl -NsSfX POST http://localhost:9090/chat/70f00f9d-9e38-4f12-a468-f866f4f8aa89 \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token)" \
  -d "Give me a random number between 1 and 100."
```

</CurlTest>

</TestScenario>

## Expose Conversation Entries API

Checkpoint `03` exposes the same conversation endpoints as the Quarkus checkpoint:
- `GET /v1/conversations/{conversation_id}`
- `GET /v1/conversations/{conversation_id}/entries`

The entries endpoint forces `channel=history` so frontend clients always receive recorded conversation turns.

<CodeFromFile

  lang="python"
  lines="90-105"
/>

<TestScenario checkpoint="python/examples/doc-checkpoints/03-with-history">

Test it with curl:

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should contain "70f00f9d-9e38-4f12-a468-f866f4f8aa89"
And the response should contain "ownerUserId"
And the response should contain "bob"
And the response should contain "accessLevel"
And the response should contain "owner"
`}>

```bash
curl -sSfX GET http://localhost:9090/v1/conversations/70f00f9d-9e38-4f12-a468-f866f4f8aa89 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token)" | jq
```

</CurlTest>

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 200
And the response body should be json:

    }

}
"""
`}>

```bash
curl -sSfX GET http://localhost:9090/v1/conversations/70f00f9d-9e38-4f12-a468-f866f4f8aa89/entries \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token)" | jq
```

</CurlTest>

</TestScenario>

## Expose Conversation Listing API

To let users see all conversations they can access, expose `GET /v1/conversations`:

<CodeFromFile
  file="python/examples/doc-checkpoints/03-with-history/app.py"
  lang="python"
  lines="107-115"
/>

The endpoint proxies query parameters (`mode`, `afterCursor`, `limit`, `query`) directly to Memory Service.

<TestScenario checkpoint="python/examples/doc-checkpoints/03-with-history">

Test it with curl:

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should contain "ownerUserId"
And the response should contain "bob"
And the response should contain "accessLevel"
And the response should contain "owner"
`}>

```bash
curl -sSfX GET http://localhost:9090/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token)" | jq
```

</CurlTest>

</TestScenario>
