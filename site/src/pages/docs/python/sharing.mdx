This guide shows how to add conversation sharing and ownership transfer APIs to the Python tutorial app.

> **New to sharing concepts?**
> Read [Sharing & Access Control](/docs/concepts/sharing/) first to understand access levels and transfer flow.

## Prerequisites

**Starting checkpoint**: This guide starts from [python/examples/doc-checkpoints/03-with-history](https://github.com/chirino/memory-service/tree/main/python/examples/doc-checkpoints/03-with-history)

Make sure you've completed:
- [Python Conversation History](/docs/python/conversation-history/) - History recording and conversation APIs
- Multiple users in Keycloak (`bob`, `alice`, `charlie`)

Also complete **Step 2** in [Python Dev Setup](/docs/python/dev-setup/) (build local `memory-service-langchain` wheel + `UV_FIND_LINKS`); this is temporary until the package is released.

## Membership Endpoints

Checkpoint `06` adds membership endpoint passthroughs to the tutorial app:

<CodeFromFile
  file="python/examples/doc-checkpoints/06-sharing/app.py"
  lang="python"
  lines="127-152"
/>

## Ownership Transfer Endpoints

Checkpoint `06` also exposes ownership transfer APIs:

<CodeFromFile
  file="python/examples/doc-checkpoints/06-sharing/app.py"
  lang="python"
  lines="155-180"
/>

## Testing Membership Management

Define a token helper for multiple users:

```bash
function get-token() {
  local username=${1:-bob}
  local password=${2:-$username}
  curl -sSfX POST http://localhost:8081/realms/memory-service/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "client_id=memory-service-client" \
    -d "client_secret=change-me" \
    -d "grant_type=password" \
    -d "username=$username" \
    -d "password=$password" \
    | jq -r '.access_token'
}
```

<TestScenario checkpoint="python/examples/doc-checkpoints/06-sharing">

Create a conversation as bob:

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 200
`}>

```bash
curl -sSfX POST http://localhost:9090/chat/a37bf20b-34eb-4471-b481-107c68ac3a9d \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token bob bob)" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "Hello, starting a sharing test conversation."
```

</CurlTest>

List memberships:

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should contain "bob"
`}>

```bash
curl -sSfX GET http://localhost:9090/v1/conversations/a37bf20b-34eb-4471-b481-107c68ac3a9d/memberships \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token bob bob)" | jq
```

</CurlTest>

Add alice as a writer:

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 201
And the response should contain "alice"
`}>

```bash
curl -sSfX POST http://localhost:9090/v1/conversations/a37bf20b-34eb-4471-b481-107c68ac3a9d/memberships \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token bob bob)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"alice","accessLevel":"writer"}' | jq
```

</CurlTest>

</TestScenario>

## Testing Ownership Transfers

Initiate an ownership transfer:

```bash
curl -sSfX POST http://localhost:9090/v1/ownership-transfers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token bob bob)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "conversationId": "a37bf20b-34eb-4471-b481-107c68ac3a9d",
    "newOwnerUserId": "alice"
  }' | jq
```

List transfers for the recipient:

```bash
curl -sSfX GET "http://localhost:9090/v1/ownership-transfers?role=recipient" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token alice alice)" | jq
```

Accept a transfer:

```bash
curl -sSfX POST http://localhost:9090/v1/ownership-transfers/<transfer-id>/accept \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token alice alice)"
```

Decline or cancel a transfer:

```bash
curl -sSfX DELETE http://localhost:9090/v1/ownership-transfers/<transfer-id> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token alice alice)"
```

## Completed Checkpoint

**Completed code**: View the full implementation at [python/examples/doc-checkpoints/06-sharing](https://github.com/chirino/memory-service/tree/main/python/examples/doc-checkpoints/06-sharing)

## What's Next

You've now added collaborative features (memberships and ownership transfer) to your Python tutorial app.

Next, continue to [Indexing and Search](/docs/python/indexing-and-search/) to add searchable indexed content.
