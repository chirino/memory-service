description: Integrate Memory Service with your Quarkus AI application.
---

These guides walk you through integrating Memory Service with a **Quarkus** application using **LangChain4j**. Start with Getting Started to build a basic AI agent with persistent memory, then progressively add features like conversation history, search, forking, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before starting any of the tutorials below, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java 21** or later
- **Maven** (or use the included `./mvnw` wrapper)
- **Docker** (for Dev Services)
- **curl** and **jq** installed

### Build from Source

> **Note:** This project is currently in the proof-of-concept (POC) phase and has not yet published any releases. You'll need to build it from source before using it in your project.

Clone the repository and build all modules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chirino/memory-service.git
cd memory-service
./mvnw -DskipTests clean install
```

This installs all project artifacts to your local Maven repository.

## Guides

### [Getting Started](/docs/quarkus/getting-started/)
Create a Quarkus AI agent and connect it to Memory Service for persistent conversation memory.

### [Conversation History](/docs/quarkus/conversation-history/)
Record conversation history and expose APIs for frontend applications to display messages.

### [Indexing and Search](/docs/quarkus/indexing-and-search/)
Add search indexing to your conversation history entries and expose a search API for frontend applications.

### [Conversation Forking](/docs/quarkus/conversation-forking/)
Let users branch off from any point in a conversation to explore alternative paths.

### [Response Resumption](/docs/quarkus/response-resumption/)
Implement streaming responses with resume and cancellation support, so users can reconnect after a disconnect.

### [Conversation Sharing](/docs/quarkus/sharing/)
Implement conversation sharing and ownership transfer between users.

### [Dev Services](/docs/quarkus/dev-services/)
Automatically start a Memory Service container in development mode, eliminating manual setup.
