This guide walks you through integrating Memory Service with a Quarkus AI agent. You'll start with basic chat memory and can progressively add features in the follow-up guides.

Make sure you've completed the [prerequisites](/docs/quarkus/) before starting this guide.

## Step 1: Create a Simple LangChain4j App

**Starting checkpoint**: View the complete code at [quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/01-basic-agent](https://github.com/chirino/memory-service/tree/main/quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/01-basic-agent)

First, let's create a new [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/get-started/) application with: 

```plain
quarkus create example
cd example
```

Add the LangChain4j OpenAI dependency to your `pom.xml`:

<CodeFromFile
  file="quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/01-basic-agent/pom.xml"
  lang="xml"
  before={2}
  after={2}
>quarkus-langchain4j-openai</CodeFromFile>

Create a simple AI service interface:

<CodeFromFile
  file="quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/01-basic-agent/src/main/java/org/acme/Agent.java"
  lang="java"
/>

Create a REST resource to expose the agent:

<CodeFromFile
  file="quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/01-basic-agent/src/main/java/org/acme/ChatResource.java"
  lang="java"
/>

Configure your LLM in `application.properties` so it gets OpenAI credentials from the environment variables and change the HTTP port to 9090 to avoid conflict with services that will be started later:

<CodeFromFile
  file="quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/01-basic-agent/src/main/resources/application.properties"
  lang="properties"
/>


<TestScenario checkpoint="quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/01-basic-agent">

Run your agent:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```
```bash
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

Test it with curl:

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 200
And the response body should be text:
"""
I am Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help answer questions and have conversations on a wide variety of topics. How can I assist you today?
"""
`}>

```bash
curl -NsSfX POST http://localhost:9090/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "Hi, I'm Hiram, who are you?"
```

</CurlTest>

**Expected**: The agent responds but has no memory of your name.

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should not contain "Hiram"
`}>

```bash
curl -NsSfX POST http://localhost:9090/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "Who am I?"
```

</CurlTest>

</TestScenario>

This works, but you may have noticed that the agent has no memory.  Each request is independent.  Let's add conversation memory.

## Step 2: Add Memory Service Extension

**Starting checkpoint**: View the complete code at [quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/02-with-memory](https://github.com/chirino/memory-service/tree/main/quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/02-with-memory)

Add the Memory Service extension to your `pom.xml`:

<Code lang="xml" code={`<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.chirino.memory-service</groupId>
    <artifactId>memory-service-extension</artifactId>
    <version>${PROJECT_VERSION}</version>
</dependency>
`} />

Update the Agent interface to accept a conversation ID using the `@MemoryId` annotation:

<CodeFromFile
  file="quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/02-with-memory/src/main/java/org/acme/Agent.java"
  lang="java"
/>

Update the REST resource to accept a conversation ID. Note the `@Blocking` annotation — this is required because the Memory Service extension uses a REST client that performs blocking I/O. Quarkus RESTEasy Reactive runs endpoints on the Vert.x event loop by default, which does not allow blocking calls. The `@Blocking` annotation moves the endpoint to a worker thread where blocking I/O is permitted.

<CodeFromFile
  file="quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/02-with-memory/src/main/java/org/acme/ChatResource.java"
  lang="java"
/>

Start the Memory Service in Docker Compose following the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) guide.

Configure the agent to connect to the Memory Service and configure OIDC authentication in `application.properties`:

<CodeFromFile
  file="quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/02-with-memory/src/main/resources/application.properties"
  lang="properties"
  after={11}
># Memory Service Client</CodeFromFile>

<TestScenario checkpoint="quarkus/examples/doc-checkpoints/02-with-memory">

Run your agent again:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

Make sure you define a shell function that can get the bearer token for the bob user:

```bash
function get-token() {
  curl -sSfX POST http://localhost:8081/realms/memory-service/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "client_id=memory-service-client" \
    -d "client_secret=change-me" \
    -d "grant_type=password" \
    -d "username=bob" \
    -d "password=bob" \
    | jq -r '.access_token'
}
```


Test it with curl—now with conversation memory:

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 200
And the response body should be text:
"""
Hi Hiram! I'm an AI created to help answer questions and provide information. How can I assist you today?
"""
`}>

```bash
curl -NsSfX POST http://localhost:9090/chat/6a6e7762-4569-4f63-b01c-c3666a27428b \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token)" \
  -d "Hi, I'm Hiram, who are you?"
```

</CurlTest>

**Expected**: The agent now remembers your name from the previous message.

<CurlTest steps={`
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should contain "Hiram"
`}>

```bash
curl -NsSfX POST http://localhost:9090/chat/6a6e7762-4569-4f63-b01c-c3666a27428b \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(get-token)" \
  -d "Who am I?"
```

</CurlTest>

</TestScenario>

The agent now remembers context within the same conversation ID!

If you browse to the demo agent app at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/), you will see that a conversation has been created with the ID `6a6e7762-4569-4f63-b01c-c3666a27428b`.
But it won't show any messages.  That's because we are not yet storing what we call the history of the conversation.  The only thing being stored is the agent memory, and 
that's not typically what you want to display to a user in a UI.

## Next Steps

Continue to [Conversation History](/docs/quarkus/conversation-history/) to learn how to:
- Record conversation history for frontend display
- Expose conversation APIs (messages, listing)
- Build a complete chat UI experience

Or jump ahead to:
- [Conversation Forking](/docs/quarkus/conversation-forking/) - Branch conversations to explore alternative paths
- [Response Resumption](/docs/quarkus/response-resumption/) - Streaming responses with resume and cancel support

## Complete Example

For a complete working example, see the `examples/chat-quarkus` directory in the repository.
