// This test used to verify the MemoryServiceChatMemoryProvider bean in the service module.
// The provider has been moved to the memory-service-extension runtime module so that it can
// be reused by downstream applications (such as the agent). Tests for the provider now
// belong in the extension module rather than the core service.
